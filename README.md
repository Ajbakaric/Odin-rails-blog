# Odin Rails Blog 

A simple Ruby on Rails blog application built as part of [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/) curriculum. This project demonstrates the fundamentals of a full-stack web application using Rails' Model-View-Controller (MVC) architecture.

##  About

This blog app allows you to:

- View a list of all articles
- Create a new article
- Edit an existing article
- Delete an article
- View each article individually

It's a minimal example designed as/with:

- Rails routing and RESTful conventions
- Controller actions and views
- Form helpers (`form_with`)
- Validations and error handling

>  Note: This project does **not** include authentication, styling, or comment features â€” it is intentionally kept simple for educational purposes.
